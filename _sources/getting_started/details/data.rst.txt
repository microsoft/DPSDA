Data
====

API reference: :doc:`/api/pe.data`.

:py:class:`pe.data.Data` is the base class for holding the synthetic samples or the private samples, along with their metadata. Different components are mostly communicated through objects of this class.
:py:class:`pe.data.Data` has two key attributes:

* ``data_frame``: A pandas_ DataFrame that holds the samples. Each row in the DataFrame is a sample, and each column is part of the sample (e.g., the image, the text, the label) and other information of the sample (e.g., its embedding produced by :doc:`embedding`).
* ``metadata``: A OmegaConf_ that holds the metadata of the samples, such as the **Private Evolution** iteration number when the samples are generated, and the label names of the classes.

Available Datasets
------------------

For convenience, some well-known datasets are already packaged as :py:class:`pe.data.Data` classes:

* Image datasets

    * :py:class:`pe.data.Cifar10`: The `CIFAR10 dataset`_.
    * :py:class:`pe.data.Camelyon17`: The `Camelyon17 dataset`_.
    * :py:class:`pe.data.Cat`: The `Cat dataset`_.
    * In addition, you can easily load a custom image dataset from a (nested) directory with the image files using :py:meth:`pe.data.load_image_folder`.

* Text datasets
    
    * :py:class:`pe.data.Yelp`: The `Yelp dataset`_.
    * :py:class:`pe.data.OpenReview`: The `OpenReview dataset`_.
    * :py:class:`pe.data.PubMed`: The `PubMed dataset`_.
    * In addition, you can easily load a custom text dataset from a CSV file using :py:class:`pe.data.TextCSV`.

Using Your Own Datasets
-----------------------
To apply **Private Evolution** to your own private dataset, you need to create a :py:class:`pe.data.Data` object that holds your dataset, with two parameters, ``data_frame`` and ``metadata``, passed to the constructor:

* ``data_frame``: A pandas_ DataFrame that holds the samples. Each row in the DataFrame is a sample. The following columns must be included:

    * :py:attr:`pe.constant.data.LABEL_ID_COLUMN_NAME`: The label (class) ID of the sample. The label IDs must be in {0, 1, ..., K-1} if there are K classes. If you are targeting unconditional generation, the values of this column can just be zeros.

    The ``data_frame`` can have any numbers of additional columns that hold the data of the samples, as long as the modules you are using (e.g., :doc:`api`, :doc:`Callbacks <callback_and_logger>`) can recognize them.

* ``metadata``: A dictionary that holds the metadata of the samples. The following keys must be included:

    * ``label_info``: A list of dictionaries that hold the information of the classes. The length of the list must be equal to K. Inside each dictionary, a key ``name`` must be included, which refers to the name of the class.

    In addition, you can include any other keys that hold the metadata of the samples if needed.
